si_planner reserves extra nodes than just the one it is at
This is done by calling nodes from a dictionary, mapping one ID to a list of IDs
It only does this for nodes in the air, allowing a distance buffer to be present in the air
Generally nodes within a certain distance are then considered reserved when a close node is reserved
The successor function does not check whether all of the nodes neighbors are open, thus allowing for buffer zones to overlap (which is good)

The distance function between the nodes is distorted by a z coefficient.
This allows for a node to reserve nodes that are further away vertically, but due to the path structure, have parallel, nearby edges
This helps preserve a buffer distance

Park nodes are only allowed as a successor if they fulfill the goal test.
This means that no paths run through park nodes, making the map a well formed infrastructure.

Heuristic uses true time now.  It is a dijkstra.

nodes become search nodes if -that node/time interval pair has not been contacted before
							-node/time interval has been contacted before, but the current arival time is earlier than previous arrival time
							-node/time interval has been contacted before, but the current cost is lower than previous cost
This insures optimal paths for each individual (optimized on lowest cost), must include higher cost/earlier arrivals because they could have access to in the end less cost path, than a later but lower cost arrival to same interval.
